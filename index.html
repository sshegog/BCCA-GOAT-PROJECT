    <p>Francesco De Virgilio is the inventor of the V6 engine. His work began pre World War II where he began his work with car maker, Lancia Aurelia and continued after retirement, collaborating and developing Diesel engines and working with Alfa Romeo on a turbocharged 4-cylinder. Mr. De Virgilio was hired at Lancia in February 1939, and also served as a technical advisor for racing engines. Due to the events of the war De Virgilio would have to wait until late 1948 to finally release to the world the first V6 engine.</p>

    <p>It was originally developed to solve the vibration issues experienced with the V4 in Lancia Aurelia, a luxury Italian car made in the 1950's. Francesco changed the setting to a V shape in order to resolve this issue. He determined a 60 degree angle offers balance, smooth operation and compact packaging. The V6 engine has powered vehicles for over a century and continues to be widely used today and are commonly found in Dodge, Nissan, Toyota, Infiniti and Honda.</p>
